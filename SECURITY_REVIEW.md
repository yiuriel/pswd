# Security & Architecture Review: Password Vault Application

## Executive Summary

Your password vault application demonstrates a **solid cryptographic foundation** with modern architecture choices. The app correctly implements end-to-end encryption with a master device concept. However, there are **critical security vulnerabilities** and architectural gaps that must be addressed before production use.

**Overall Assessment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moving in the right direction, but needs critical fixes**

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working Well

### 1. **Strong Cryptographic Foundation**
- ‚úÖ Using `libsodium-wrappers` (industry-standard NaCl library)
- ‚úÖ X25519 key exchange and Ed25519 signing keys
- ‚úÖ Proper use of `crypto_secretbox` for symmetric encryption
- ‚úÖ Password hashing with `bcrypt` (cost factor 12)
- ‚úÖ Proper random nonce generation for each encryption operation
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded encryption keys in client-side code

### 2. **Good Storage Security Model**
- ‚úÖ IndexedDB encryption with session-specific keys
- ‚úÖ No localStorage usage for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Session key zeroed on page unload
- ‚úÖ Private keys stored encrypted in IndexedDB

### 3. **Solid Backend Architecture**
- ‚úÖ Go + PostgreSQL is a good tech stack choice
- ‚úÖ Proper database schema with CASCADE deletion
- ‚úÖ Transaction handling for multi-step operations
- ‚úÖ Using `credentials: 'include'` for cookie-based auth
- ‚úÖ HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS token theft

### 4. **Master Device Concept**
- ‚úÖ Clear distinction between master and secondary devices
- ‚úÖ Device fingerprinting implemented
- ‚úÖ Master device registration flow is well-structured

## üîç Missing Security Features

### 1. **No Audit Logging**
Implement logging for:
- Failed login attempts
- Device registrations
- Vault access
- Password changes
- Entry modifications

### 2. **No Session Management**
- No session timeout
- No ability to view/revoke active sessions
- No concurrent session limits

### 3. **No 2FA/MFA**
Consider adding:
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- Backup codes

### 4. **No Password Breach Detection**
Integrate with:
- Have I Been Pwned API
- Password strength estimation (zxcvbn)

### 5. **No Encrypted Backup/Export**
Users should be able to:
- Export encrypted vault
- Import from backup
- Sync across devices

### 6. **No Secure Password Sharing**
If needed, implement:
- Time-limited sharing
- Read-only vs. full access
- Sharing audit trail

## üêõ Code Quality Issues

### 1. **Error Handling Inconsistent**
Some places return detailed errors (bad), others generic (good).

### 2. **Missing Logging**
Backend has minimal structured logging.

**Fix:** Use structured logging library:
```go
import "go.uber.org/zap"
```

### 3. **No Health Check Endpoint**
Add `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for monitoring.

### 4. **Database Connection Not Closed**
```go
defer db.Close()
```

### 5. **No Graceful Shutdown**
Server doesn't handle SIGTERM/SIGINT properly.

### 6. **Frontend Error Boundaries Missing**
Add React error boundaries to prevent crashes.

### 7. **No Loading States for Crypto Operations**
Crypto operations are CPU-intensive and should show progress.

## üéØ Overall Security Score

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Cryptography** | 8/10 | Strong foundation, minor issues with key management |
| **Authentication** | 5/10 | Good cookie usage, but missing 2FA and has vulnerabilities |
| **Authorization** | 6/10 | Basic implementation, needs device approval |
| **Data Protection** | 7/10 | Good client-side encryption, needs key recovery |
| **Network Security** | 4/10 | Missing HTTPS enforcement, insecure cookies |
| **Input Validation** | 4/10 | Minimal validation on backend |
| **Error Handling** | 5/10 | Some information leakage |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | 3/10 | Minimal logging |
| **Overall** | **5.25/10** | Good start, needs critical fixes |

## ‚ú® Conclusion

Your application shows **strong cryptographic knowledge** and follows many security best practices. The architecture with a master device concept is sound, and your use of libsodium shows you understand modern cryptography.

**However**, there are critical issues that must be fixed before production:
- Hardcoded JWT secret
- Insecure cookie settings  
- Key management logic needs completion
- Missing vault unlock mechanism after reload

Once these are addressed, you'll have a solid foundation for a secure password vault. The master device concept is well-implemented, and your zero-knowledge architecture (server never sees plaintext) is exactly right.

**Keep going - you're on the right track!** üîê
