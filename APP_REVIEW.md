---

## üö® Critical Security Issues

### 1. **JWT Secret Hardcoded (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)**
**Location:** `/backend/internal/auth/jwt.go:20`
```go
var jwtSecret = []byte("your-secret-key-change-this-in-production") // TODO: Move to environment variable
```

**Risk:** Anyone with this secret can forge authentication tokens for any user.

**Fix Required:**
- Move to environment variable immediately
- Generate a cryptographically secure random secret (min 256 bits)
- Never commit the actual secret to version control
- Rotate secrets periodically in production

```go
var jwtSecret = []byte(os.Getenv("JWT_SECRET"))

func init() {
    if len(jwtSecret) == 0 {
        log.Fatal("JWT_SECRET environment variable is required")
    }
    if len(jwtSecret) < 32 {
        log.Fatal("JWT_SECRET must be at least 32 bytes")
    }
}
```

---

### 2. **CORS Configuration Too Permissive (SEVERITY: HIGH)**
**Location:** `/backend/cmd/server/main.go:52-59`
```go
AllowedOrigins: []string{"http://localhost:5173", "http://localhost:3000"},
```

**Risk:** In production, this needs to be strictly controlled.

**Fix Required:**
- Use environment variable for allowed origins
- Never use wildcards (`*`) in production
- Implement proper origin validation

```go
allowedOrigins := strings.Split(os.Getenv("ALLOWED_ORIGINS"), ",")
if len(allowedOrigins) == 0 {
    allowedOrigins = []string{"https://yourdomain.com"}
}
```

---

### 3. **Insecure Cookie Settings (SEVERITY: HIGH)**
**Location:** `/backend/internal/auth/jwt.go:127`
```go
Secure: false,  // Set to true in production with HTTPS
```

**Risk:** Cookies can be intercepted over HTTP, allowing session hijacking.

**Fix Required:**
```go
Secure: os.Getenv("ENV") == "production",
SameSite: http.SameSiteStrictMode, // Change from Lax to Strict
```

---

### 4. **SQL Injection Vulnerability Potential (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
**Location:** Throughout handlers

**Current State:** Using `$1, $2` placeholders ‚úÖ (Good!)
**Risk:** Low currently, but must maintain this practice.

**Recommendation:** Consider using an ORM or query builder like `sqlx` or `gorm` for additional safety.

---

### 5. **No Rate Limiting (SEVERITY: HIGH)**
**Missing:** Login/register endpoints have no rate limiting.

**Risk:** Brute force attacks on passwords and username enumeration.

**Fix Required:**
```go
import "golang.org/x/time/rate"

// In middleware
limiter := rate.NewLimiter(5, 10) // 5 req/sec, burst of 10
if !limiter.Allow() {
    http.Error(w, "rate limit exceeded", http.StatusTooManyRequests)
    return
}
```

---

### 6. **Username Enumeration (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
**Location:** Login returns different errors for "user not found" vs "invalid password"

**Risk:** Attackers can enumerate valid usernames.

**Fix:** Always return generic "invalid credentials" message.

```go
if err != nil || !auth.VerifyPassword(req.Password, passwordHash) {
    http.Error(w, "invalid credentials", http.StatusUnauthorized)
    return
}
```

---

### 7. **Missing Input Validation (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
**Location:** Throughout handlers

**Missing:**
- Email format validation (backend)
- Username length/character restrictions
- Password complexity enforcement (backend)
- Device fingerprint validation

**Fix:** Add validation layer:
```go
func validateEmail(email string) error {
    if !emailRegex.MatchString(email) {
        return errors.New("invalid email format")
    }
    return nil
}
```

---

### 8. **No CSRF Protection (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
**Current:** SameSite cookies provide some protection, but not sufficient.

**Fix Required:**
- Implement CSRF token validation for state-changing operations
- Use double-submit cookie pattern or synchronizer tokens

---

### 9. **Device Fingerprint Weakness (SEVERITY: MEDIUM)**
**Location:** `/frontend/src/helpers/SecureCrypto.ts:247-268`

**Issues:**
- Includes random component ‚Üí not deterministic across sessions
- Easily spoofed
- Not cryptographically secure

**Fix:**
```typescript
async generateDeviceFingerprint(): Promise<string> {
    // Try to get stored fingerprint FIRST
    const stored = await this.storage.get("device_fingerprint");
    if (stored) return stored;
    
    // Only generate once and persist
    const components = [
        nav.userAgent,
        nav.language,
        screen.colorDepth.toString(),
        screen.width + "x" + screen.height,
        new Date().getTimezoneOffset().toString(),
        // Remove random component for consistency
    ];
    
    // Use crypto hash instead of btoa
    const data = new TextEncoder().encode(components.join("|"));
    const hash = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', data);
    const fingerprint = sodium.to_base64(new Uint8Array(hash));
    
    await this.storage.set("device_fingerprint", fingerprint);
    return fingerprint;
}
```

---

### 10. **Master Key Recovery Not Implemented (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)**
**Missing:** If user loses master device, they lose ALL data.

**Fix Required:**
- Implement recovery key generation during registration
- Store recovery key encrypted with user password
- Implement key escrow or backup mechanism
- Consider multi-signature recovery requiring multiple devices

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture & Design Concerns

### 1. **Decryption Key Management Issue**
**Problem:** Your vault entries are encrypted with a key derived from the master encryption private key:

```typescript
const privateKeyBytes = sodium.from_base64(keys.encPrivateKey);
const key = sodium.crypto_generichash(32, privateKeyBytes);
```

**Issue:** The `encPrivateKey` stored in IndexedDB is **itself encrypted** (during registration):
```typescript
const encPrivKeyEncrypted = sodium.crypto_secretbox_easy(
    encKeyPair.privateKey, encNonce, masterKey
);
```

**Problem:** You're storing the encrypted private key, but when you try to use it for vault encryption, you never decrypt it first! This means:
1. During registration, you encrypt the private key with password-derived master key ‚úÖ
2. You store the encrypted blob ‚úÖ
3. Later when encrypting vault entries, you hash the **encrypted** private key (not the plaintext) ‚ùå

**Critical Fix Needed:**
You need to either:
- **Option A:** Decrypt the private key before using it (requires password re-entry)
- **Option B:** Store the plaintext private key in encrypted IndexedDB (current session key protects it)
- **Option C:** Derive vault encryption key directly from password (not from keypair)

**Recommended Approach:**
```typescript
// Store keys in memory after decryption during login
private vaultKey: Uint8Array | null = null;

async unlockVault(password: string) {
    const encPrivateKey = await this.storage.get("master_enc_sk");
    const salt = await this.storage.get("salt");
    
    const masterKey = await this.deriveKeyFromPassword(password, sodium.from_base64(salt));
    
    // Decrypt the private key
    const combined = sodium.from_base64(encPrivateKey);
    const nonce = combined.slice(0, sodium.crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES);
    const ciphertext = combined.slice(sodium.crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES);
    
    const privateKey = sodium.crypto_secretbox_open_easy(ciphertext, nonce, masterKey);
    
    // Derive vault encryption key
    this.vaultKey = sodium.crypto_generichash(32, privateKey);
}
```

---

### 2. **Password Not Re-requested After Page Reload**
**Problem:** After page reload, the app can't decrypt private keys because:
- Password is not stored anywhere ‚úÖ (correct!)
- Master key is derived from password
- But you need master key to decrypt private keys

**Current Behavior:** Likely broken - you can't decrypt vault entries after reload.

**Fix:** Implement "unlock vault" flow:
1. User logs in ‚Üí gets session cookie
2. App loads ‚Üí prompts for password to unlock vault
3. Derive master key from password
4. Decrypt private keys
5. Store decrypted keys in memory (not IndexedDB)

---

### 3. **No Device Approval Mechanism**
**Missing:** Master device should approve secondary devices.

**Recommended Flow:**
1. Secondary device registers ‚Üí gets pending status
2. Master device receives notification
3. Master device approves ‚Üí encrypts vault key for secondary device using its public key
4. Secondary device can now access vault

---

### 4. **No Vault Key Rotation**
**Missing:** If a device is compromised, you can't rotate encryption keys.

**Fix:** Implement key versioning:
```sql
ALTER TABLE vault_entries ADD COLUMN key_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

---

### 5. **Database Security Missing**
**Location:** `/backend/cmd/server/main.go:30`
```go
sslmode=disable
```

**Fix:**
- Enable SSL for database connections in production
- Use connection pooling with limits
- Implement database audit logging

---

## üîç Missing Security Features

### 1. **No Audit Logging**
Implement logging for:
- Failed login attempts
- Device registrations
- Vault access
- Password changes
- Entry modifications

### 2. **No Session Management**
- No session timeout
- No ability to view/revoke active sessions
- No concurrent session limits

### 3. **No 2FA/MFA**
Consider adding:
- TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password)
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- Backup codes

### 4. **No Password Breach Detection**
Integrate with:
- Have I Been Pwned API
- Password strength estimation (zxcvbn)

### 5. **No Encrypted Backup/Export**
Users should be able to:
- Export encrypted vault
- Import from backup
- Sync across devices

### 6. **No Secure Password Sharing**
If needed, implement:
- Time-limited sharing
- Read-only vs. full access
- Sharing audit trail

---

## üêõ Code Quality Issues

### 1. **Error Handling Inconsistent**
Some places return detailed errors (bad), others generic (good).

### 2. **Missing Logging**
Backend has minimal structured logging.

**Fix:** Use structured logging library:
```go
import "go.uber.org/zap"
```

### 3. **No Health Check Endpoint**
Add `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for monitoring.

### 4. **Database Connection Not Closed**
```go
defer db.Close()
```

### 5. **No Graceful Shutdown**
Server doesn't handle SIGTERM/SIGINT properly.

### 6. **Frontend Error Boundaries Missing**
Add React error boundaries to prevent crashes.

### 7. **No Loading States for Crypto Operations**
Crypto operations are CPU-intensive and should show progress.

## ‚ú® Conclusion

Your application shows **strong cryptographic knowledge** and follows many security best practices. The architecture with a master device concept is sound, and your use of libsodium shows you understand modern cryptography.

**However**, there are critical issues that must be fixed before production:
- Hardcoded JWT secret
- Insecure cookie settings  
- Key management logic needs completion
- Missing vault unlock mechanism after reload

Once these are addressed, you'll have a solid foundation for a secure password vault. The master device concept is well-implemented, and your zero-knowledge architecture (server never sees plaintext) is exactly right.

**Keep going - you're on the right track!** üîê
